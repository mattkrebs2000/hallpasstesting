Teachers can establish their own rules for their classes in \"Behaviors to Address\" -then select from those rules when placing a kid 'In Penalty.'

If a student goes on a pass and returns after the pass' time-limit he/she will have that amount of time subtracted from their Over/Under. This Number shows up in the \"Main Menu\" screen for students and in \"Students Enrolled\" for teachers.

The \"Consequences for Lateness\" that this App provides is meant to be a deterrent from being late. Prior to being allowed to go on pass, a student who has a Negative Over/Under score and also \"Consequences for Lateness\" must first accurately enter into an input box a provided statement. If he/she does this correctly the App will provide access to the rest of the \"Pass\" process. If a students Over/Under is minimal (0 to -10 minutes) the statements that they must transcribe is relatively simple. After -10 minutes, the challenge becomes much more difficult -in that a student must transcribe it in with a unique pattern of lower case and upper case letters (for example every other letter must be Upper Case). This \"Consequences For Lateness\" feature can be activated/deactivated from the 'Students Enrolled' screen and the Over/Under can also be cleared if for example a student provides a good excuse or serves detention.</Text>\n\n                <Text style={styles.paragraph99}>{'\\n'}Text to be Transcribed - if Students Over/Under is between 0 and -5.</Text>\n\n                <Text style={styles.paragraph21}>I will try not to be late this time.
